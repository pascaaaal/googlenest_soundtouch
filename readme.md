# Google Nest - Soundtouch Chime

This cute little python script can forward a google nest doorbell ring to your soundtouch speaker. It currently just plays the standard notifications _(In the future maybe there also will be support for custom sounds)_.

Bevore setting up, you have to create a SDM project on the google page. There is a tutorial [here](https://developers.google.com/nest/device-access/registration).

Then fill the .env file. Add your service account as a `credentials.json` and copy your `refresh_token` response inside the `tokens.json`. This should look something like that:

```json
{
  "access_token": "Your access token",
  "expires_in": 3599,
  "generatedAt": 1735655864.449936, //This will be generated by the script / Not neccessary
  "refresh_token": "Your refresh token",
  "scope": "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/sdm.service",
  "token_type": "Bearer"
}
```

In the .env file, add the missing parameters

```bash
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="Your service account config. ex. credentials.json"
CLIENT_SECRET="AOuth2 Client Secret"
CLIENT_ID="OAuth2 Client ID"
TOKENS_FILE="the tokens file. eg. tokens.json"
DEVICE_CLIENT_ID="SDM Project ID"
PROJECT_ID="GCP Project ID"
SUBSCRIPTION_ID="Subscription ID of the PubSub Project"
```
